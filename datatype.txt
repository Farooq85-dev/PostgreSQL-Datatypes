DataTypes:-
Data types are a way to limit the type of data that can be stored in a table.

Most widely used are:-

1) Numeric - INT 
2) String - VARCHAR
3) Date - DATE 
4) TimeStamp - TIMESTAMP
4) Boolean - BOOLEAN
5) Textual Json data - json
6) Time - time

Constraint:-
A constraint in PostgreSQL is a rule applied to a column. SQL allows you to define constraints on columns and tables. Constraints give you as much control over the data in your tables as you wish. If a user attempts to store data in a column that would violate a constraint, an error is raised. This applies even if the value came from the default value definition. 


Some of the constraints are below:-

Primary Key:-
. The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each
record in a table.
. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot
contain NULL values.
. A table can have only ONE primary key.

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name text,
    price numeric
);

NOT NULL:- 
. It ensure that value must be present.

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    price numeric
);

UNIQUE:-
. Unique constraints ensure that the data contained in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among all the rows in the table. The syntax is:

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer UNIQUE,
    name text,
    price numeric
);

DEFAULT:-
. It ensure that if user does not enter default value. Then, a default Value applied.

CHECK:-
. A check constraint is the most generic constraint type. It allows you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a Boolean (truth-value) expression. A check constraint can also refer to several columns. For instance, to require positive product prices, you could use:

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric CHECK (price > 0)
);

Foreign Keys:-
A foreign key constraint specifies that the values in a column (or a group of columns) must match the values appearing in some row of another table. We say this maintains the referential integrity between two related tables.

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    price numeric
);
